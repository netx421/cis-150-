# This code creates a report that contains an 
# apartment complex rental agent's commission. The 
# program accepts the ID number and name of the agent who 
# rented the apartment, and the number of bedrooms in the 
# apartment. The commission is $100 for renting a three-bedroom 
# apartment, $75 for renting a two-bedroom apartment, $55 for 
# renting a one-bedroom apartment, and $30 for renting a studio 
# (zero-bedroom) apartment. Output is the salespersonÂ’s 
# name and ID number and the commission earned on the rental.
